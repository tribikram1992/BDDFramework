BDD XPath Scenario Generator – Features Summary
1. Action Recording
Automatic Action Detection:
The extension injects content scripts into every web page you visit. These scripts listen for user actions such as clicks, input changes, form submissions, hovers, double-clicks, drag-and-drop, and alert/prompt/confirm popups.
Rich Action Metadata:
For each action, it records:
The type of action (click, input, select, etc.)
The most robust XPath (and other locator strategies) for the target element
A suggested element name (based on tag, id, name, aria-label, etc.)
Frame and window context (handles iFrames and multiple windows/tabs)
The value entered (for input/change actions)
Element type (button, dropdown, input, etc.)
Timestamp and additional options (e.g., dropdown values)
All possible locators (XPath, id, name, class, etc.) except for css, jsPath, linkText, and partialLinkText, as per latest logic
2. Locator Suggestions and Editing
Multiple Locator Strategies:
When an action is recorded, the extension suggests multiple XPath locators for the target element, including:
By id, name, class, data-attributes, and combinations thereof
By tag and attributes (excluding style and href attributes)
Robust XPath combinations (excluding css, jsPath, linkText, partial link text)
User Editing:
In the popup UI, users can:
Select from a dropdown of suggested XPaths for each action
Edit the XPath manually in an input field
Name the element or change the suggested name for use in generated files
3. Scenario Management
URL Loading:
Users can enter and load any URL in a new browser window directly from the extension popup. The session is tracked and actions are recorded for that session.
Scenario Naming:
Users can provide a descriptive name for each scenario, which is used in the generated feature and step definition files.
Clear & Reset:
Users can clear all recorded actions and reset the session from the popup UI.
4. BDD Scenario and Step Generation
Gherkin Feature File Generation:
The extension can generate a .feature file for the recorded scenario using Gherkin syntax, mapping each recorded action to a Given/When/Then step (using appropriate keywords for action types).
Java Step Definition Generation:
It generates Java step definition skeletons (StepDefinition.java) for use with Cucumber, matching the steps in the feature file and using the suggested element names.
Each step definition includes a TODO comment for implementing the actual step
The element repository is referenced by the element's suggested name
5. Object Repository & Data Mapping
Object Repository JSON:
The extension generates a JSON file mapping each element’s suggested name to its primary locator and additional context (type, frame, etc.).
Test Data Mapping:
It generates a data mapping file that maps suggested element names to actual values entered during recording.
Full Action Export:
All recorded actions can be exported as a JSON array for further processing or audit.
6. Advanced Handling
Alert/Prompt/Confirm:
Automatically captures browser alert, confirm, and prompt dialogs, including their text and user response.
Frame & Window Awareness:
The extension is aware of iFrames and multiple windows/tabs, capturing frame paths and window identifiers for every action.
Hover Action Recording (with Logic):
Hovers are recorded only if no click follows within a short interval, to avoid redundant steps.
Only user-triggered events (not programmatically triggered ones) are recorded.
7. UI/UX Features
Popup Interface:
Visual list of all recorded actions for the current session.
Dropdown and input for locator selection/editing.
Editable element names.
Buttons for loading a URL, clearing actions, generating files, and exporting JSON.
Scenario name input and validation.
8. State Management & Persistence
Session-Based Recording:
Each scenario/session is tracked using a unique session ID.
Chrome Storage:
All actions, scenario names, and URLs are saved in chrome.storage.local, ensuring persistence across popup opens/closes and page reloads.
